# 队列（只是对链表做了点封装）

In computer science, a queue is a particular kind of abstract data 
type or collection in which the entities in the collection are 
kept in order and the principle (or only) operations on the 
collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal 
position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the 
front terminal position, known as dequeue. This makes the queue 
a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. 

In a FIFO data 
structure, the first element added to the queue will be the 
first one to be removed. 

This is equivalent to the requirement 
that once a new element is added, all elements that were added 
before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. 

Often a peek or front operation is also entered, returning the 
value of the front element without dequeuing it. A queue is an 
example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a 
sequential collection.

在计算机科学中，队列是一个特殊的数据类型或集合

在一个先进先出的数据结构，
这相当于要求 一旦添加一个新元素，所有元素在移除之前被添加。通常顶部操作进来，不需要出队就可返回第一个元素的值。队列是一个线性数据结构或者更抽象序列结合。
