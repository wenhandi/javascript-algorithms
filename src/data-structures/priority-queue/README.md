# Priority Queue

In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type 
which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where 
additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. 
In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before 
an element with low priority. If two elements have the same 
priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

While priority queues are often implemented with heaps, they are 
conceptually distinct from heaps. A priority queue is an abstract 
concept like "a list" or "a map"; just as a list can be implemented
with a linked list or an array, a priority queue can be implemented
with a heap or a variety of other methods such as an unordered 
array.


优先队列是一个像常规队列和栈的数据结构，除了每个元素有个优先属性相关联。在优先队列中，高优先级的元素先于低优先级的元素被处理。若两个元素有相同优先级的，由在队列中的顺序决定。

优先队列常用堆实现，但两者概念截然不同。优先队列像一个列表或者映射的抽象概念；就像用链表或数组实现的列表一样，优先队列可被一个堆或者一个其他的方法的变种例如无序数组。
