# Graph

In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type 
that is meant to implement the undirected graph and 
directed graph concepts from mathematics, specifically
the field of graph theory
图是一个意味着实现无向和有向图特别图论领域的抽象数据类型。
A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly 
mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together 
with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an 
undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a 
directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, 
or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines 
for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of 
the graph structure, or may be external entities 
represented by integer indices or references.
图数据结构有一个有限的（可能是可变的）顶点、节点、点集合组成的， 
一起的还有一套顶点的无序对作为无序图或者有序图的一套无序对。
这些对被称为边缘，圆弧或线为了一个无线图。顶点也许是图结构的一部分，或者可以是外部权利由整数索引或引用表示。
